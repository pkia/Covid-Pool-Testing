# Covid pool testing
This repo was the winning entry for an [Open data Hackathon](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/evan-dunbar-a184641a1_hackathon-innovation-ai-activity-6788889024556752896-BcOf) hosted by Munster Technological University, Cork, Ireland
sponsored by Riot Games, CSO, ADVANCE CRT and Lero Research Centre. 

## Overview:
As a team we recognised the inefficient method of testing for Covid-19 used in Ireland and implemented a more efficient
method using a variation of binary splitting based on the findings from Timo de Wolff's [research paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0243692) reducing the amount of tests required by 45%
